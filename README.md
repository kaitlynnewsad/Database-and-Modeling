# Database and Modeling 

I took this class in Fall 2021. I learned modeling and database design and writing SQL statements and PL/SQL statements. For the final project of the class we had to design a database for a made up company. The project had to include E-R diagrams, relational schema, data dictionary, and tables created by SQL. I received an 100% on this project.
